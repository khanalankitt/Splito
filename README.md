# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your actual values
   # - Add your Firebase configuration
   # - Add your Discord webhook URL
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure. You need to set up the following variables:

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Discord Webhook URL (for notifications)
EXPO_PUBLIC_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
```

### Getting Firebase Configuration

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project or create a new one
3. Go to Project Settings > General
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" and select your app
5. Copy the configuration values

### Getting Discord Webhook URL

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Right-click on the channel where you want notifications
3. Select "Edit Channel" > "Integrations" > "Webhooks"
4. Create a new webhook and copy the URL

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already added to `.gitignore`.
